FARKLE RULES
======================================================================================================
Farkle is a dice game that is multi-player with a minimum of two players, but no upper limit on the 
number of participants. 

The goal is to reach 5,000 points first.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
POINTS:

Points are acquired one of three different ways.

  * A roll of a 1 is worth 100 points.
  * A roll of a 5 is worth 50 points.
  * Three dice rolled at the same time with the same value is worth 100 times the face value. 
    For example: three 2's is 200 points and three 3's rolled is worth 300 points.
  * One exception is that three 1's rolled is 1,000 points, not 100.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    
THE PLAY:

  * The first player rolls all six dice at the same time and sets aside any "point dice" (1's, 5's,
    or three of a kind). At this point the player has the option to continue to roll the remaining 
    dice to collect even more points, or stop and keep any points acquired. 
  * A Farkle occurs when the dice are rolled and no point dice appear. At this point the player loses
    all the point dice they have collected during that turn and the play passes to the next player.
    No points are recorded for that player's turn.
  * If a player decides not to risk rolling a Farkle then they can stop rolling and the player passes 
    to the next player. Any points collected during that turn are recorded.
  * If all six dice become point dice and are set aside, the player has a "Bonus Roll" which means the player must 
    roll all six dice at least one more time before stopping and keeping the points collected.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
SECRET SREATEGY:

  * All point dice do not have to be set aside. If you roll a 1 and a 5, sometimes 
    it may be strategic to keep the 1 and roll the 5 again with the rest of the non-point dice. This 
    may give you a better chance of rolling a three of a kind. But, at least one point die must be 
    set aside after each roll.

WINNING:

In order to win, a player must get 5,000 points recorded.

After a player gets over 5,000, each of the other players get one turn to try to beat the first 
player who goes out. The player with the highest score at the end is declared the winner!
