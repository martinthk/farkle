# farkle
Farkle is a dice game that rolls 6 dices to create a range of scoring combinations.

It is multi-player with a minimum of two players, but no upper limit on the number of participants. 

The goal is to reach 5,000 points first.

## Points

Points are acquired one of three different ways:
  * A roll of a 1 is worth 100 points.
  * A roll of a 5 is worth 50 points.
  * Three dice rolled at the same time with the same value is worth 100 times the face value. 
    For example: three 2's is 200 points and three 3's rolled is worth 300 points.
  * One exception is that three 1's rolled is 1,000 points, not 100.
