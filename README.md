# farkle
Farkle is a dice game that rolls 6 dices to create a range of scoring combinations.

It is multi-player with a minimum of two players, but no upper limit on the number of participants. 

The goal is to reach 5,000 points first.

## Points

Points are acquired one of three different ways:
  * A roll of a 1 is worth 100 points.
  * A roll of a 5 is worth 50 points.
  * Three dice rolled at the same time with the same value is worth 100 times the face value. 
    For example: three 2's is 200 points and three 3's rolled is worth 300 points.
  * One exception is that three 1's rolled is 1,000 points, not 100.

## Winning

In order to win, a player must get 5,000 points recorded.

After a player gets over 5,000, each of the other players get one turn to try to beat the first 
player who goes out. The player with the highest score at the end is declared the winner!
